### Install Homebrew

Now that your Terminal is setup, it's time to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), the de facto package manager for OS X. If you've never heard of a package manager, think of it as an App Store of **free** command line programs.

To get started, run the following command:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

**TIP:** Be sure to agree when asked to install the **XCode CommandLine Tools**.


### Update Homebrew

If you've previously installed Homebrew, now's a good time to update it by running:

```
brew update
```

**TIP:** Run this command periodically as Homebrew doesn't auto-update itself. :sweat:


### Verify Homebrew

To verify Homebrew is installed correctly, run the following command:

```
brew doctor
```

And you'll see something like this:

```
Your system is ready to brew.
```
